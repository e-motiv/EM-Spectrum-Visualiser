<b>MicroWaves or µW <i>(1GHZ - 3000 GHZ)</i></b><br>
Radio-frequencies are going higher and higher (due to better technology and crowdiness of lower frequencies), nowadays µwaves are also used for radiocommunication.</p>
<p>Sources: Stars, Sun    </p>
<p>Uses:
      Microwave-oven (2.45 GHZ Water and fat absorb these frequencies and heat up)</use> Radar (around 10 GHZ) At these frequencies the wave reflects on most objects, especially on metal surfaces. From the reflection and time-delay, detected at the radarstation, the distance, direction and surface of objects are generated.</use> Communication (satellites; high capacity comm. devices)</use></p>
