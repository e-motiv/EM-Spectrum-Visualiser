<title>Ultraviolet or UV or Blacklight</title> <range>400 nm - 1 nm</range>
<body><intro>UV-A (380-315 nm), UV-B (315-280 nm), and UV-C (280-10 nm)<br/>
UV lies just above the visible spectrum, hence ultra violet (beyond violet).  It's mostly know for the responsable wave for a brown tan. </intro>

<br/><sources>Sources:</sources><source>Stars, Sun, BB, Heat</source>

<br/><uses>Uses:</uses>
<use>Solar cel (zonnecel), photolithography (a.o. in making microchips), spectroscopy</use>
<use>Washing powders (to look 'whiter' due to fluorescent dyes)</use>
<use>Analysis of minerals, detective work</use>
<use>Astronomy (which radiation doesn't this use ?)</use>
<use>UV-A: Blacklights (fluorescent lamps), skin tanning, skin therapy</use>
<use>UV-C: Disinfection/Sterilization (air, water, surfaces)</use>

<br/><effects>Effects:</effects>
<effect>makes bees "see" interesting flowers</effect>
<effect>Besides tanning (which is the result of brown pigment melaninon which itself blocks UV as a defense), the upper ranges are unhealthy for our skin (UV-B, UV-C) and can produce skin cancer (UV-B)</effect>
<effect>UV-B (and UV-C somewhat) can destroy DNA if it can reach it.</effect>
<effect>Germicidal ultraviolet (UV-C / 253.7 nm): kills germs, such as bacteria, viruses, mold, fungi and spores</effect>
