<title>MicroWaves or µW</title> <range>(1 GHZ - 3000 GHZ)</range>
<body><intro>Radio-frequencies are going higher and higher (due to better technology and crowdiness of lower frequencies), nowadays µwaves are also used for radiocommunication.</intro>

<br/><sources>Sources:</sources><source>Stars, Sun</source>

<br/><uses>Uses:</uses>
<use>- Microwave-oven (2.45 GHZ Water and fat absorb these frequencies and heat up)</use>
<use>- Radar (around 10 GHZ) At these frequencies the wave reflects on most objects, especially on metal surfaces. From the reflection and time-delay, detected at the radarstation, the distance, direction and surface of objects are generated.</use>
<use>- Communication (satellites; high capacity comm. devices)</use>
