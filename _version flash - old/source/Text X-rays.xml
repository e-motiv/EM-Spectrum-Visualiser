<title>X-rays or Röntgen rays</title> <range>1 nm - 5 pm</range>
<body><intro>Because of their small wavelength, they are able to penetrate almost everything, flowing through electrons (and nuclei ?), but not transparently through hard matter.  This is why these are commonly used in radiology (by doctor or dentist)
Though penetrating matter, on a smaller scale, cells and DNA can absorb them and thus be damaged.
This is why they are used in radiotherapy, where a certain doze is used to kill cancer cells for example.<br/>
X-rays are primarily used for diagnostic medical imaging and crystallography</intro>
