# EM-Spectrum-Visualiser
A multi-purpose graphical tool to explore, learn, calculate and visualise everything around the electromagnetic spectrum.

A long time ago e-motiv.et (aka Ruben Goethals) had some free time on his hands, so he created the same tool in Flash. Flash together with actionscript was a promising platform for graphical presentations. Even today (2017) its benifits and possibilities are not matched. Unfortunatly, someone (like a certain former director of Apple) have made it possible to fade out Flash from popular acceptance. (You won't hear this from all the Flash haters out there though, but well..)

It was even linked in the main "EM Spectrum" article of Wikipedia, until some editors thought it was a commerial link after I changed my domain from e-builds.com to e-motiv.net. Even though it was free.

It seems a lot of people hate progress somehow or just like authority..

Anyway, e-motiv would hate his efforst to go to waste. This is a trial to revive this interesting tool via html and javascript and SVG. He hopes someone or multiple persons take interest in it and take over the torch and this tool would be a standard tool for teachers, students, physicists and many more..
