<h1>Ultraviolet or UV or Blacklight</h1> <div class="range">400 nm - 1 nm</div>
<div class="intro">UV-A (380-315 nm), UV-B (315-280 nm), and UV-C (280-10 nm)<br/>
UV lies just above the visible spectrum, hence ultra violet (beyond violet).  It's mostly know for the responsable wave for a brown tan. </div>

<h2 class="sources">Sources:</h2>
<div>Stars, Sun, BB, Heat</div>

<h2 class="uses">Uses:</h2>
<div>Solar cel (zonnecel), photolithography (a.o. in making microchips), spectroscopy</div>
<div>Washing powders (to look 'whiter' due to fluorescent dyes)</div>
<div>Analysis of minerals, detective work</div>
<div>Astronomy (which radiation doesn't this use ?)</div>
<div>UV-A: Blacklights (fluorescent lamps), skin tanning, skin therapy</div>
<div>UV-C: Disinfection/Sterilization (air, water, surfaces)</div>

<h2 class="effects">Effects:</h2>
<div>makes bees "see" interesting flowers</div>
<div>Besides tanning (which is the result of brown pigment melaninon which itself blocks UV as a defense), the upper ranges are unhealthy for our skin (UV-B, UV-C) and can produce skin cancer (UV-B)</div>
<div>UV-B (and UV-C somewhat) can destroy DNA if it can reach it.</div>
<div>Germicidal ultraviolet (UV-C / 253.7 nm): kills germs, such as bacteria, viruses, mold, fungi and spores</div>
