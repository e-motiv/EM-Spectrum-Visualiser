<div class="intro">...are mostly know as the waves that is emitted as a by-product of radioactive processes.  They are at the top of the spectrum that humans can reproduce.<br/>
From this point forward, waves start to be very dangerous because they interact on the nuclei in atoms.  </div>

<h2 class="sources">Sources:</h2>
<div>A lot of things in space: super-/hypernovas (exploding (massive)stars), supernova remnants (caused by radio active decay), pulsars (fast spinning (600 rps) of huge objects), afterglow (cooling gasses), jets (result of black hole annihilations)</div>
<div>Nuclear power, radioactive material, particle accelerators</div>

<h2 class="uses">Uses:</h2>
<div>This band of the spectrum is most crowded with uses for 1001 devices such as:
<div>Mobile phones, satellite communications, radar, TV, radio, .. </div>
</div>
<h2 class="effects">Effects:</h2>
<div>Kills or mutates living cells</div>
