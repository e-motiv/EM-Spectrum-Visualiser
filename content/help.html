You can customize and add data in several parts of this movie, such as allocations, applications, black bodies and attenuation, special frequencies, emission lines, ...<br/>Everything works via XML files in the folder of the movie, starting with the menus "Menuallocation.xml, ...".<br/>Have a look at them and make your own.  if you do, you are more than welcome to send them to me (<u><a href="mailto:Ruben@e-builds.com">Ruben@e-builds.com</a></u>).  I will publish them all on the webspace of this movie.  Sharing is the future!  ;-)
(I am also considering any comments, feature requests...)
