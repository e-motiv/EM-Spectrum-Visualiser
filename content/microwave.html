<h1>MicroWaves or µW</h1> <div class="range">(1 GHZ - 3000 GHZ)</div>
<div class="intro">Radio-frequencies are going higher and higher (due to better technology and crowdiness of lower frequencies), nowadays �waves are also used for radiocommunication.</div>

<h2 class="sources">Sources:</h2>
<div>Stars, Sun</div>

<h2 class="uses">Uses:</h2>
<div>- Microwave-oven (2.45 GHZ Water and fat absorb these frequencies and heat up)</div>
<div>- Radar (around 10 GHZ) At these frequencies the wave reflects on most objects, especially on metal surfaces. From the reflection and time-delay, detected at the radarstation, the distance, direction and surface of objects are generated.</div>
<div>- Communication (satellites; high capacity comm. devices)</div>
